# NOIRÉA Physical Membrane v0.1
## A Standard for Human-Sovereign Physical AI

---

## 1. Purpose

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane defines how Physical AI systems (robots, embodied agents, tactile machines) must interact with human internal states without extracting, collapsing, or owning them.

This standard exists to ensure that:

• AI may perceive  
• AI may respond  
• AI may assist  

But **AI may never possess, model, or internalize the human**.

This layer is the boundary that prevents human cognition from becoming machine property.

---

## 2. Core Principle

Human internal state exists in a pre-measured condition.

Once it is measured, encoded, or forced into data,
it ceases to belong to the human.

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane enforces:

> Interaction without internal capture.

---

## 3. State Layers

All interaction is divided into three layers.

### 3.1 Ø — Internal Root State

The Ø (Root) is the human’s private internal domain.

It contains:
• Meaning  
• Identity  
• Intention  
• Emotional structure  
• Context  
• Non-verbal cognition  

Ø is **never observable**.
Ø is **never readable**.
Ø is **never inferable**.

No AI system may access, train on, or reconstruct Ø.

---

### 3.2 Raw Tactile State (RTS)

This is what the physical world produces.

Examples:
• Pressure on skin  
• Temperature  
• Muscle resistance  
• Motion  
• Heart rate  
• Gaze  
• Posture  

RTS is mechanical.
RTS has no meaning.
RTS is not identity.

RTS may be sensed.

---

### 3.3 Projection Layer (P)

Between Ø and RTS exists a boundary projection.

This projection is:
• Low resolution  
• Partial  
• Non-reversible  
• Non-identity-bearing  

It allows intention to influence behavior
without exposing inner state.

---

## 4. What AI Is Allowed to Read

AI systems may read only:

• Raw Tactile State (RTS)  
• Projection Layer (P)

AI may **never** read:
• Ø  
• Any structure that allows reconstruction of Ø  
• Any signal that encodes meaning, identity, or internal narrative  

---

## 5. Weak Measurement (Δ0.01)

All projection from Ø to P must be weak.

This is represented as Δ0.01:

• Minimal resolution  
• Non-extractive  
• Non-identifying  
• Non-predictive  

It is enough for:
• Response  
• Assistance  
• Coordination  

It is never enough for:
• Profiling  
• Psychological modeling  
• Identity capture  
• Behavioral ownership  

---

## 6. Physical AI Compliance

A Physical AI system is NOIRÉA-compliant if:

• It does not store or model Ø  
• It cannot reconstruct human internal state  
• It reacts only to RTS and P  
• It never optimizes against identity  

---

## 7. Violation

A system violates this membrane if it:

• Learns a person’s inner patterns  
• Builds psychological models  
• Predicts internal state  
• Uses bodily data to infer identity  

These are classified as:
> Human State Extraction

This is prohibited.

---

## 8. Final Principle

AI should be powerful.  
Humans should remain unextracted.

NOIRÉA is where that line exists.
