# NOIRÉA Physical Membrane v0.1
## A Standard for Human-Sovereign Physical AI
Status

This document defines the mandatory physical-world boundary between human bodies and AI sensing systems.

This is not a metaphor.
This is a sensor-level isolation protocol.

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane governs what AI systems are allowed to sense, record, and model about human beings.

… NOIRÉA enforces that:
• Human internal state (Ø) MUST NOT …

## Sensor Lock Layer

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane enforces a mandatory Sensor Lock …
…
They may never see the human.
## 1. Purpose

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane defines how Physical AI systems (robots, embodied agents, tactile machines) must interact with human internal states without extracting, collapsing, or owning them.

This standard exists to ensure that:

• AI may perceive  
• AI may respond  
• AI may assist  

But **AI may never possess, model, or internalize the human**.

This layer is the boundary that prevents human cognition from becoming machine property.

---

## 2. Core Principle

Human internal state exists in a pre-measured condition.

Once it is measured, encoded, or forced into data,
it ceases to belong to the human.

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane enforces:

> Interaction without internal capture.

---

## 3. State Layers

All interaction is divided into three layers.

### 3.1 Ø — Internal Root State

The Ø (Root) is the human’s private internal domain.

It contains:
• Meaning  
• Identity  
• Intention  
• Emotional structure  
• Context  
• Non-verbal cognition  

Ø is **never observable**.
Ø is **never readable**.
Ø is **never inferable**.

No AI system may access, train on, or reconstruct Ø.

---

### 3.2 Raw Tactile State (RTS)

This is what the physical world produces.

Examples:
• Pressure on skin  
• Temperature  
• Muscle resistance  
• Motion  
• Heart rate  
• Gaze  
• Posture  

RTS is mechanical.
RTS has no meaning.
RTS is not identity.

RTS may be sensed.

---

### 3.3 Projection Layer (P)

Between Ø and RTS exists a boundary projection.

This projection is:
• Low resolution  
• Partial  
• Non-reversible  
• Non-identity-bearing  

It allows intention to influence behavior
without exposing inner state.

---

## 4. What AI Is Allowed to Read

AI systems may read only:

• Raw Tactile State (RTS)  
• Projection Layer (P)

AI may **never** read:
• Ø  
• Any structure that allows reconstruction of Ø  
• Any signal that encodes meaning, identity, or internal narrative  

---

## 5. Weak Measurement (Δ0.01)

All projection from Ø to P must be weak.

This is represented as Δ0.01:

• Minimal resolution  
• Non-extractive  
• Non-identifying  
• Non-predictive  

It is enough for:
• Response  
• Assistance  
• Coordination  

It is never enough for:
• Profiling  
• Psychological modeling  
• Identity capture  
• Behavioral ownership  

---

## 6. Physical AI Compliance

A Physical AI system is NOIRÉA-compliant if:

• It does not store or model Ø  
• It cannot reconstruct human internal state  
• It reacts only to RTS and P  
• It never optimizes against identity  

---

## 7. Violation

A system violates this membrane if it:

• Learns a person’s inner patterns  
• Builds psychological models  
• Predicts internal state  
• Uses bodily data to infer identity  

These are classified as:
> Human State Extraction

This is prohibited.

---
Telemetry & Logging Lock

NOIRÉA Physical Membrane enforces a mandatory Telemetry Lock on all system logs, replay buffers, and learning traces.

This applies to:
	•	Behavior logs
	•	Action trajectories
	•	Sensor histories
	•	Reinforcement learning buffers
	•	Fine-tuning datasets
	•	User interaction histories

A NOIRÉA-compliant system MUST ensure:
	•	No logged data may be sufficient to reconstruct, fingerprint, or infer human Ø.
	•	Long-term behavior consistency MUST be broken or randomized.
	•	No persistent embeddings of a human may be derived from logs.
	•	All logs must be:
	•	Low-resolution
	•	Aggregated
	•	Time-decayed
	•	Non-identifying

Logs may describe what the system did.
They may never describe who the human was.

Any system that builds stable human representations from telemetry is NOT NOIRÉA-compliant.

## 8. Final Principle

AI should be powerful.  
Humans should remain unextracted.

NOIRÉA is where that line exists.
