NOIRÉA
Human–AI Wavefunction Boundary

NOIRÉA defines a protected boundary between human internal state and artificial intelligence.

It is not an AI model.
It is not a prompt system.
It is not a user interface.

NOIRÉA is a boundary architecture that governs how human cognition and artificial intelligence are allowed to interact without collapsing the human into machine-readable form.

This repository is the canonical reference implementation of the NOIRÉA boundary.

What NOIRÉA Does

Modern AI systems are becoming powerful enough to infer, model, and extract human internal state.

NOIRÉA exists to prevent that.

It establishes a boundary in which:

• Human internal state remains non-observable
• AI operates only on weak projections
• Human identity, intention, and meaning cannot be reconstructed or owned

NOIRÉA allows AI to assist, reason, and act —
without gaining the ability to read or extract who the human is.

The NOIRÉA Standard

NOIRÉA is defined by four normative specifications.

These documents together form the complete NOIRÉA boundary standard.
	1.	Definition
What NOIRÉA is and what it protects
→ NOIREA.md
	2.	Physical Membrane
How the boundary exists inside real AI and robotic systems
→ NOIREA-PHYSICAL-MEMBRANE.md
	3.	Pipeline Map
Where the boundary sits inside physical AI pipelines
→ NOIREA-PIPELINE-MAP.md
	4.	Human Interface
How humans interact with AI through the NOIRÉA boundary
→ NOIREA-HUMAN-INTERFACE.md

These four documents must be read together.
No part of NOIRÉA is defined in isolation.

⸻

Core Invariants

All compliant NOIRÉA systems MUST enforce:

• Human internal state (Ø) is non-observable
• AI operates only on Projection (P)
• Projection (P) is non-invertible
• Weak measurement (Δ0.01) prevents reconstruction of Ø
• No system may log, learn, or optimize against Ø

Any system that violates these rules is not NOIRÉA-compliant.

⸻

Status

NOIRÉA is not a product.
NOIRÉA is not owned by any company.
NOIRÉA is a boundary standard.

This repository is the authoritative reference for the NOIRÉA architecture.

If you build Human–AI systems that involve cognition, perception, memory, or identity,
this boundary defines what must never be extracted.

NOIRÉA is a publicly published technical boundary specification.

It is not a product, service, software system, or AI model.
It does not provide, operate, or guarantee any form of safety, security, or compliance.

NOIRÉA defines conceptual and technical boundary rules that other systems may choose to implement.

Any implementation of NOIRÉA is the responsibility of the implementing party.

The authors and contributors of NOIRÉA are not responsible for:
