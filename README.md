# NOIRÉA

**Human–AI Wavefunction Boundary Layer**

NOIRÉA defines how human internal cognitive states can interact with artificial intelligence without being extracted, flattened, or surrendered.

This repository contains the first open boundary architecture for Human–AI coexistence.

## What is NOIRÉA?

NOIRÉA is not an AI model.  
NOIRÉA is not a product.  
NOIRÉA is not a brand.

NOIRÉA is a **boundary layer** between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

It defines how intention, memory, perception, and reasoning can exist and influence AI systems **without becoming machine-readable or harvestable**.

**[NOIREA.md](./NOIREA.md)**

## Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

As AI systems gain bodies, sensors, and real-world agency, a new risk appears:

**Human internal state becomes physically extractable.**

NOIRÉA introduces a boundary system that prevents this.

It defines:

- What a machine may read
- What must remain internal
- How projection replaces extraction

This is formalized in:

**[NOIREA-PHYSICAL-MEMBRANE.md](./NOIREA-PHYSICAL-MEMBRANE.md)**

This document is a **first-of-its-kind boundary specification** for Physical AI.

## Why this matters

AI should be powerful.  
Humans should remain sovereign.

NOIRÉA defines where that line exists.

## Status

This repository contains:

- A foundational definition of NOIRÉA
- The first Physical AI boundary standard

It is intended to be:

- Read by engineers
- Implemented by Physical AI teams
- Referenced by researchers
- Preserved by humans

NOIRÉA is not software.

NOIRÉA is a **structural boundary for the future of intelligence**.
