NOIRÉA is not an AI model.

NOIRÉA is a boundary between human identity and artificial intelligence.

It defines how internal cognitive states (prompts, memory, reasoning, embeddings) can exist and evolve without being exposed, harvested, or reverse engineered.

This repository contains the canonical definition of:

Human–AI Wavefunction Boundary
Protected Root Space (Ø)
Weak Measurement (0.01)
Perception Projection
NOIRÉA Membrane

NOIRÉA enables:

– Private AI agents
– Protected creative cognition
– Safe human–AI co-creation
– Enterprise-grade internal state security

This is not a product.
This is a new layer of reality.
