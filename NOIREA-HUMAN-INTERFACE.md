NOIRÉA Human Interface v0.1

Protected Human–AI Interaction Boundary

⸻

1. Purpose

NOIRÉA Human Interface defines a protected interaction layer between humans and artificial intelligence systems.

Its goal is to allow humans to collaborate with AI without exposing their internal cognitive state — including intention, identity, meaning, and self-model — to machine-readable extraction.

This interface prevents humans from being reduced to data, while still allowing AI systems to operate effectively.

⸻

2. Core Model

All interaction is separated into three domains:
Human Ø (Internal State)
        ↓
   Projection P (Weak Measurement)
        ↓
     AI System
     The system enforces that:
	•	Human Ø is never observable
	•	AI operates only on Projection P
	•	Projection P is non-invertible

⸻

3. Definitions

Ø — Human Internal State

A protected, non-observable space containing:
	•	Intention
	•	Identity
	•	Meaning
	•	Context
	•	Self-model
	•	Cognitive structure

Ø is not data.
Ø cannot be logged, stored, learned, or reconstructed.

⸻

P — Projection

A weak, lossy, externally visible representation of Ø.

Projection is:
	•	Partial
	•	Low-resolution
	•	Non-invertible
	•	Purpose-bound

Projection is the only thing AI is allowed to see.

⸻

Δ0.01 — Weak Measurement

The rule that Projection must always contain:
	•	Noise
	•	Ambiguity
	•	Loss of identity

This prevents AI from reconstructing Ø from outputs.

⸻

4. Human Interaction Rules

Humans do not provide raw cognitive state.

They provide:
	•	Intent signals
	•	Directional meaning
	•	Contextual hints

These are transformed into Projection P inside Ø, not by AI.

The human controls:
	•	What is projected
	•	How much is projected
	•	When projection changes
	•	When projection stops
