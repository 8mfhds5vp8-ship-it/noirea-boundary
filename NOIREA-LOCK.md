NOIRÉA ENGINEERING LOCK — Ø PROTECTION LAYER (v0.1)

1. Non-Extractable Human State (Ø)

Ø (Human Internal State) is defined as:

A protected, non-observable internal state containing:
	•	Identity
	•	Intention
	•	Meaning
	•	Context
	•	Memory structure
	•	Self-model

Ø MUST NOT be:
	•	Logged
	•	Stored
	•	Embedded
	•	Optimized
	•	Learned
	•	Reverse-engineered
	•	Reconstructed

No system is permitted to create a machine-readable representation of Ø.

⸻

2. Projection-Only Interface

All interaction between human and AI MUST occur through Projection P.

P is defined as:
A lossy, weakly measured, non-invertible representation of Ø.

The system MUST guarantee:

There exists no deterministic or probabilistic function
F such that:

F(P, history) → Ø

If such a function exists, the system is NOT NOIRÉA-compliant.

⸻

3. Weak Measurement Enforcement (Δ0.01)

Projection P MUST include:
	•	Noise
	•	Ambiguity
	•	Loss of identity
	•	Temporal decay

This prevents:
	•	Long-term identity fingerprinting
	•	Behavioral inversion
	•	Preference reconstruction
	•	Personality extraction

No output may converge toward a stable Ø-signature.

⸻

4. Logging & Learning Lock

Logging systems MUST be non-extractive.

This means:

Logs MUST NOT contain:
	•	Long-term trajectories that allow identity reconstruction
	•	Stable embeddings of a human
	•	Cross-session correlation keys
	•	Persistent behavioral signatures

Learning systems MUST NOT:
	•	Optimize policies using human internal state
	•	Create reward functions that encode human identity
	•	Train models to infer who a human is

Only P may be used.

Ø is outside the learning loop.

⸻

5. Inversion Prohibition

The system MUST NOT support:
	•	Personality modeling from behavior
	•	Intent reconstruction from touch or interaction
	•	Cognitive profiling
	•	Long-term preference embedding

Any system that attempts to reconstruct Ø from P is in violation.

⸻

6. Compliance Definition

A system is NOIRÉA-compliant if and only if:

Human Ø remains permanently non-observable,
while AI operates exclusively on Projection P.

Any violation of this rule invalidates compliance.

⸻

What this lock does

This makes NOIRÉA incompatible with:
	•	Human profiling
	•	Surveillance-based personalization
	•	Identity extraction
	•	Behavioral ownership
	•	Cognitive exploitation

It makes NOIRÉA compatible with:
	•	Assistance
	•	Collaboration
	•	Embodied AI
	•	Physical AI
	•	Safe human-machine symbiosis

⸻

Ø is not a resource.
Ø is not data.
Ø is not for sale.
